# Source-grounded development (shared, every profile)

> Profile skill `source-grounded-development`: Mandatory before writing code in any repository profile. Establish every type, member, contract, registration, and business rule from the repository itself before changing it; never generate speculative APIs.

Applies in every repository. The active profile's own skills say *how* code is written there; this skill says *what
must be proven first*. Shipped baseline (see `profiles/README.md`).

## Before writing any code

1. **Repository and solution:** run `profile -Repo <id>`. Continue only with status `DETECTED` or `CONFIRMED`, or with
   `NO_PROFILE` (then follow the repository's own patterns). With `AMBIGUOUS` or `UNCERTAIN`, inspect the solution files
   and project structure, ask the developer which solution the work belongs to, and confirm with `-Key`. Never decide
   from a feature or entity name: the same names (for example Formula) exist in more than one system.
2. **Git state:** branch, HEAD, and pre-existing changes (`branchinfo`). Pre-existing changes are not yours; do not
   reformat, revert, or include them.
3. **The feature:** locate it with `context -Repo <id> -Query "<nouns and verbs>"`, then read the files themselves.
4. **Entry point to data:** read the existing function or endpoint, the command or query it dispatches, and its handler.
5. **Service contract:** the service interface and every implementation of it.
6. **Models:** request, response, and domain models the change touches, with nullability and serialization attributes.
7. **Validation:** the validators and business-rule helpers that already own the rule, and how their errors reach the
   caller (exception type, middleware, response shape).
8. **Callers and dependents:** every caller of a method you will change (search by name and by interface member).
9. **Registration:** where the handler, service, and validator are registered, and with which lifetime.
10. **Tests:** the existing tests for this feature and its closest sibling, and the test framework and mocking library
    they use.
11. **Reuse:** search for an existing helper, constant, mapper, or service that already does the work.
12. **Smallest safe change:** write down the files to change and why each one is needed; anything not on that list stays
    unchanged.

## Search order and when to stop

Exact symbol or file name (`context -Query "<ExactName>"` answers with `exact: true`, the file, its tests, and its direct
callers) -> the feature folder -> direct callers and interfaces -> service implementations -> registration -> related
tests -> wider search. Stop widening once every type, member, rule owner, and registration the change relies on has
`path:line` evidence; do not open unrelated large files or re-read whole files you already cited. Independent reads may
be batched or run in parallel; edits, builds, and test runs are never run in parallel on the same files or outputs.

## Validation ownership (every change that adds, moves, or reviews a rule)

1. Find every place the rule or a near copy lives today: validators, handlers, collaborators, services, factories,
   data access, and, when the PBI names one, the legacy source it came from.
2. Report duplicates and conflicts (same rule twice, different messages or conditions for the same input).
3. Decide the owner by what the rule needs: input shape and required fields -> the feature's validator, as siblings do;
   rules that need data lookups or other aggregates -> where siblings already place such rules (a validator with
   injected services, or a business service); orchestration and state changes -> the handler or service. Not every
   rule belongs in a validator, and a validator never changes state.
4. Prefer extending the feature's existing validator or service over a new standalone validator or collaborator.
5. Keep business behavior, error contracts (exception type, property name, message, status), and any validation order
   clients depend on.

## Abstractions: add or remove

- **Before adding** a collaborator, helper, interface, factory, query service, extension method, dependency container,
  or registration: search for an existing equivalent, check its naming against siblings, list its real consumers, and
  check the layer boundary. One consumer and one implementation with no sibling precedent means it is not needed;
  avoid wrappers, duplicate interfaces, and duplicate queries.
- **Before removing** one: find every reference (by name and by interface), its registration and lifetime, its test
  dependencies, and any reflection, assembly scanning, or convention-based registration that reaches it. Remove it only
  when nothing at run time or in tests still needs it, and update the registration in the same change.

## Proof rules

- A class, interface, method, property, namespace, DTO field, CRM entity or attribute, GraphQL operation or field,
  option-set value, or configuration key may be used only after you have seen it in the repository (or in generated code
  produced by the repository's own generation step). Quote `path:line` in the plan for each one you rely on.
- Examples in instruction or skill files (including this folder) are patterns, not code that exists. Validate every name
  against the repository before using it; never copy placeholder names into production code.
- Changing a method signature: inspect every implementer and every caller first; update them all or do not change it.
- Changing a response model: inspect every consumer (functions, clients, UI services, contract tests); prefer additive
  changes; a breaking change is a Stop condition.
- Changing validation: confirm which layer owns the rule today and how its error is translated; do not duplicate it in
  another layer.
- A dependency you cannot find (a type, a generated client, a plugin's behavior, a CRM field) is recorded as
  **UNVERIFIED** in the plan, with what was searched and where. Never write an implementation for it on assumption.
- Assumptions are checked by the build and tests: a type you introduced must compile, an interface implementation must
  match its contract, and a test must exercise the real code path, not a copy of it.

## Anti-hallucination gate (before the plan is approved and again before handover)

Reject the change, or the plan item, if any of these holds: a nonexistent class or member; an unverified method; a wrong
namespace; the wrong solution or repository profile; an interface implemented incorrectly; an invented DTO property;
incorrect service registration or lifetime; an option-set value not found in the source; assumed plugin behavior; an
exception contract that differs from the existing one; an invented GraphQL operation or field; an incorrect CRM SDK model.
Then run `git diff --check` and read the complete diff of every changed file.
